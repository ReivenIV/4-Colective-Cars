#### Welcome:

##  With CSSgrid, flexbox and Gsap

#### Collection:
The idea here it was to create a website with many animations and an scroll bar blocked thanks to the framework GreenSock. I have the feeling that these framework has lot of potential and i will defenitly check it out.  


## Project Status
It's only 3 cars but it could be much longer. 
The is finish and i'm moving on to other projets. i'm open to proposition or critics. Feel free to use it and change it as you will. The code is easily reusable in case you wanna change it.
